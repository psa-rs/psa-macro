PSA particle size analyzer for ImageJ

The Particle Size Analyzer ("PSA") macro for ImageJ helps with the analysis of TEM images of nanoparticles, i.e. to get the particle size distribution of a sample studied by TEM. In the field of NP synthesis this is a routine task that may be tedious if the particles have to be all analyzed one-by-one. The macro has been developed for the semi-automatic analysis of inorganic nanoparticles of more or less spherical shape, but works with other particles, too. It is designed to help with 
  * setting the image scale 
  * detecting particles by intensity thresholding 
  * applying size and shape exclusion criteria 
  * calculating the area-equivalent diameter and 
  * automatically saving all results. 
  
The macro is intended to provide a user-friendly and easy-to-use interface for semi-automatic image analysis.



The project was formerly hosted on Google code, now in the archives: https://code.google.com/archive/p/psa-macro/

I transferred it here to provide it a new place to live. Updates will follow soon.
